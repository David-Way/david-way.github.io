			"content_html": "<p>Powerful modern CSS tooling and features have made achieving desired effects easier and more robust than ever.</p>\n<p>When the &quot;how&quot; is so trivial you barely have to think about it you can lose some of the time and as a result the deeper understanding of the Why's and Whens that comes as a side effect of trial and error.</p>\n<p>I'll take this opportunity to share a few more nuanced points of view I've pondered up in my years of pushing (and failing to push) pixels that I feel I might have missed if things were always as easy as they are today.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mobile-first\" tabindex=\"-1\">Mobile first? <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/css-strategy/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The &quot;direction&quot; you write your CSS in should, for simplicity's sake, likely follow whatever convention your team has established already. Ideally, you should implement both options,on a case-by-case basis, and use the direction that results in the least amount of or most elegant code. Ultimately the key value here is to be thinking and designing in a mobile first mindset. &quot;Space is not a given, space is a progressive enhancement, the pattern I choose will work first in the restrictions of a small screen and adapt to take advantage of any additional space where available&quot;. The direction you implement that design in is less important.</p>\n<h2 id=\"using-rems-means-my-fonts-are-responsive\" tabindex=\"-1\">Using rems means my fonts are responsive? <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/css-strategy/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Responsive fonts <em>and type settings</em> must adjust to screen size, but also to the user's configuration. Remember that browser settings and browser plugins exist to allow users to override the base font size and the zoom level of any site. Your text should respond relatively to maintain hierarchy. Rems is how you achieve this. But don't forget the line lengths, language type direction and your typesetting space also needs to be proportional to maintain the responsive readability of the text.</p>\n<h2 id=\"when-is-the-concept-of-aspect-ratio-applicable-in-web-design\" tabindex=\"-1\">When is the concept of aspect ratio applicable in web design? <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/css-strategy/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Enforcing an aspect ratio, via the padding bottom trick or the modern aspect-ratio property, should be reserved exclusively for graphics content (images, diagrams, video, maps, and some data tables). Responsive design is fundamentally about making the most of available space and avoiding overflow and multidirectional scrolling. The concept of enforcing an aspect ratio goes against this by preventing reflow or fluid resizing (wrapping text will increase in height as it is reduced in width) and risking overflow or two-dimensional scrolling. However, WCAG Success Criterion 1.4.10 for reflow has specific exceptions for some graphic content, listed above, as there is position and relational information encoded within these elements that cannot easily be adjusted to all screen contexts, and squished images are visually unappealing. Therefore, aspect ratios and the two-dimensional scrolling they risk are permitted and may be recommended.</p>\n<h2 id=\"is-performance-in-css-important-what-s-worth-focusing-on\" tabindex=\"-1\">Is performance in CSS important? What's worth focusing on? <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/css-strategy/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Finely tuned code splitting, lazy loading/preloading assets, auditing and automating unused styles culling, file  minification, inlining critical above the fold render path styles, optimising animations to use hardware acceleration and avoid triggering repaints. These have the largest effect on the metrics we care the most about, reducing bundle size, minimizing FLOUT and other layout jank, preventing render thread blocking and minimizing time to first paint. CSS is rarely the main cause of performance issues and in some cases the complexity incurred by these methods can be like picking up pennies infront of a steam roller and the energy would be best spent elsewhere (media and JavaScript). These are all worth investing some level of effort into, however...</p>\n<p>Low selector specificity will barely nudge the needle on any of these metrics but I single it out for specific &quot;performance&quot; focus for it's outsized effect on the style architecture, agility, scalability and maintainability of a project. Also, developer sanity.</p>\n<h2 id=\"design-tokens-are-not-just-about-scalability-reuse-performance-theme-abilty-and-consistency\" tabindex=\"-1\">Design tokens are not just about scalability, reuse, performance, theme-abilty and consistency. <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/css-strategy/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Dessign tokens are about imbuing meaningful relationships between your design decisions.</p>\n<p>Capturing these relationships with meaningful names (and in a single place) makes understanding the downstream effects of changes and implementing accessibility best practices, such as maintaining sufficient color contrast, much simpler.</p>\n<h2 id=\"more-to-come\" tabindex=\"-1\">More to come... <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/css-strategy/\">#</a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"it-s-2025-should-i-still-consider-a-pre-proccessor\" tabindex=\"-1\">It's 2025, should I still consider a pre-proccessor? <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/css-strategy/\">#</a></h3>\n<h3 id=\"css-in-js-for-or-against\" tabindex=\"-1\">CSS in JS, for or against? <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/css-strategy/\">#</a></h3>\n<!-- ### Tailwind \n\npros: don't have to name things anymore, declaration order becomes ignorable\ncons: component system don't benefit \n\nbetter solutions exists, CSS modules, many worse solutions also exist  -->\n",

I always enjoy having written, but I rarely enjoy the act of writing itself.</p>\n<p>One of the more enjoyable aspects of having this site is having a place to tinker with things and explore ideas. Sometimes that enjoyment becomes a &quot;productive&quot; distraction from that primary goal.</p>\n<p>A <span class=\"u-display:none-when-color-scheme:dark\">dark</span><span class=\"u-display:none-when-color-scheme:light\">light</span> theme one of the first things I implemented for this site.</p>\n<p>But before adding a feature for a features sake I asked myself the following two questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Should you provide a <span class=\"u-display:none-when-color-scheme:dark\">dark</span><span class=\"u-display:none-when-color-scheme:light\">light</span> mode?</li>\n<li>Should I add a theme toggle control?</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"u-bleed-container:x-small u-mv:16\">\n<div class=\"u-border:device\">\n<div class=\"u-display:none-when-color-scheme:dark\">\n<picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://david-way.github.io/img/7IBMMDz3G--480.avif 480w\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://david-way.github.io/img/7IBMMDz3G--480.webp 480w\"><img alt=\"The not-important site in dark mode\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://david-way.github.io/img/7IBMMDz3G--480.png\" width=\"480\" height=\"820\"></picture>\n</div>\n<div class=\"u-display:none-when-color-scheme:light\">\n<picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://david-way.github.io/img/9uQ3FqWwOD-480.avif 480w\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://david-way.github.io/img/9uQ3FqWwOD-480.webp 480w\"><img alt=\"The not-important site in light mode\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://david-way.github.io/img/9uQ3FqWwOD-480.png\" width=\"480\" height=\"820\"></picture>\n</div>\n</div>\n<figcaption>\nThis very site, <span class=\"u-display:none-when-color-scheme:dark\">brooding in dark mode</span><span class=\"u-display:none-when-color-scheme:light\">beaming away in light mode</span>.\n</figcaption>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"question-1-should-you-provide-a-darklight-mode\" tabindex=\"-1\">Question 1: Should you provide a <span class=\"u-display:none-when-color-scheme:dark\">dark</span><span class=\"u-display:none-when-color-scheme:light\">light</span> mode? <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/dark-mode-toggles/\">#</a></h2>\n<div class=\"u-display:none-when-color-scheme:dark\">\n<p>A dark color scheme can reduce eye strain, especially in low-light environments, can extend battery life (for certain OLED display types), and some users find dark mode visually appealing and modern.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"u-display:none-when-color-scheme:light u-bleed-container:default\">\n<p>Light mode has been the standard for a long time, and many users are accustomed to it, so it has become an expected feature.</p>\n<p>Light mode is generally more readable in well-lit environments. A <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0018720813515509\">Human Factors study suggests light mode enhances the legibility of text</a>, and as a result, the reading comprehension and proofreading performance of the reader. Light backgrounds can also be more conducive to displaying accurate colors in some scenarios.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Neither dark or light mode is objectively superior; each has its merits and pitfalls that depend on individual preferences and other factors out of your control. The most responsible course of action is obviously to offer both a light and dark mode and let the user decide.</p>\n<p>Once I was finished implementing the <span class=\"u-display:none-when-color-scheme:dark\">dark</span><span class=\"u-display:none-when-color-scheme:light\">light</span> mode, I'm slightly embarrassed to say, I was excited to work on a cool toggle switch.</p>\n<h2 id=\"question-2-should-i-add-a-theme-toggle-control\" tabindex=\"-1\">Question 2: Should I add a theme toggle control? <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/dark-mode-toggles/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>My first intuition was that the answer to this question would be an obvious &quot;yes&quot;. In an effort to honestly evaluate the feature, what follows are the best reasons I could come up with.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Appeal of Novelty</strong>: Because it will be fun (think of all the time we can spend tweaking the easing curve on an elaborate sun into moon animation) 🤓</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Optimism bias</strong>: Because it's easy. Once you have the theme designed and implemented in CSS Custom properties, the code to implement switching between modes using a toggle is trivial</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bandwagon effect</strong>: Because everyone has one (someone even built a beautiful site dedicated to <a href=\"https://toggles.dev/\">cataloging common theme toggle types</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Vanity</strong>: Because I put all this effort into supporting a <span class=\"u-display:none-when-color-scheme:dark\">dark</span><span class=\"u-display:none-when-color-scheme:light\">light</span> mode, not every site has one, so why not make it discoverable and easily accessible?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Less than convincing. Perhaps you can think of better reasons or perhaps I should have asked a more open question. A question like &quot;How should the user select a theme?&quot;.</p>\n<p>This is a better question as it opens up the mind to lateral possibilities, diverging from the narrow focus of a solution. The next thought came easier.</p>\n<p>Users already have a global and robust way to define their preferred theme and browsers do a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme#browser_compatibility\">good job</a> of honoring the application of these preferences!</p>\n<figure class=\"u-bleed-container:small\">\n<picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://david-way.github.io/img/CGmqmhpy5U-736.avif 736w\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://david-way.github.io/img/CGmqmhpy5U-736.webp 736w\"><img alt=\"The Android theme controls also allow for scheduling for when a particular theme should be applied\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://david-way.github.io/img/CGmqmhpy5U-736.png\" width=\"736\" height=\"311\"></picture>\n<figcaption>The Firefox mode selector allows you to explicitly set your preference for the browser or to defer to a preference you've set more broadly at the Operating System level</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p></p><div class=\"c-inset-text\">\n<span>\nℹ️ However it's important that the default value should be set to use the system preference and that the users shouldn't see a <a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/flash-of-inaccurate-color-theme-fart/\">Flash of inAccurate coloR Theme</a> which is very likely as the code to store and and respond to previous preference is going to be running after a page’s first render.\n</span>\n</div><p></p>\n<p>These controls work system-wide/device-wide, often at the Operating System level (where the user can set it once) and at a per-application level where users can automatically adjust their preferred theme based on conditions like the time of day or ambient light conditions.</p>\n<figure class=\"u-bleed-container:x-small\">\n<picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://david-way.github.io/img/kkXhc6VNwP-738.avif 738w\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://david-way.github.io/img/kkXhc6VNwP-738.webp 738w\"><img alt=\"The Android theme controls also allow for scheduling for when a particular theme should be applied\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://david-way.github.io/img/kkXhc6VNwP-738.png\" width=\"738\" height=\"914\"></picture>\n<figcaption>The Android theme controls also allow for scheduling for when a particular theme should be applied</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>From a theming perspective, there is nothing unique enough about this site. Nothing that I should have any reason to think it would be an exception to how a visitor would normally prefer to consume their content. Users spend most of their time on other websites, so they expect your site to work like all the other sites they already know. It's also reasonable for them to expect those sites to honor configuration decisions they have already made.</p>\n<p>Adding a theme toggle to the page adds design redundancy at the cost of complicating a simple feature. It's also an extra tab stop for keyboard/screen reader users and an additional eye fixation as well as extra code to maintain.</p>\n<p></p><blockquote class=\"c-block-quote\">\n<p class=\"c-block-quote__content\">\n…[Perfection is achieved] not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.</p>\n<p></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"c-block-quote__footer\">— <cite>Antoine de Saint-Exupery.

			"content_html": "<p>Storytelling is how the human mind likes to consume information. Our thoughts synchronize with that of the storyteller. Listening to a well told story is almost to experience it ourselves.</p>\n<p>In design, we rely on it as an efficient and valuable tool for communicating complex information and compelling our listeners to care and engage more deeply with the problem we're looking at.</p>\n<p>However, stories don't always need to make logical sense. We are, occasionally, willing to suspend disbelief if the story <em>or</em> the storyteller is engaging enough...</p>\n<p>While preparing a recent presentation after a large (and what felt at the time like a diligently executed) piece of design research, I was fine-tuning the narrative from the scenario we storyboard-ed earlier that day. Suddenly, a glaringly obvious plot hole appeared to me. An obvious omission that could affect the result and direction of our proposed design. The team of very motivated domain and product experts were working closely together on th project for two weeks straight. Through workshops, user testing sessions, and debriefing sessions, no one thought to bring it up or ask about it? Whatever the cause or causes, it was worrying at this late stage of the project.</p>\n<p>We were scheduled to present our findings and recommendations the next day. Should we reschedule the playback? I scrambled to the team; hopefully, someone knew the answer. Luckily, this particular question could be answered before the presentation, and it didn't change or invalidate the design recommendations we were making. But we got lucky...</p>\n<p>Times like these highlight the importance of adhering to a good research process. Mistakes happen, lapses in judgment, bias, and blind spots. We are human after all. In a fast-moving project, some themes can go unnoticed, or their impact can be underappreciated. Some half-formed ideas can be ripped from your focus by other priorities before they are fully formed and interrogated.</p>\n<p>A systematic approach will catch more information and represent it more clearly but looking back, the main contributing factor to this episode was not making enough time to write and consolidate my understanding as I went.</p>\n<p>Writing is really good at finding holes in your knowledge or reasoning. If you can't entirely outline a thought or set of points into a written sentence or paragraph, then you probably need to finish exploring or formulating that thought.</p>\n<p>Discussion and presentation can encourage us to consciously or unconsciously follow the happy path, ignoring difficult threads of thought in need of more robust exploration.</p>\n<p>Writing concisely and frequently throughout the design process is just as important as any other design process task. Summarizing learnings and ideas. Forming them into cogent sentences. Writing down checklists of questions and, importantly, circulating this information frequently with the team helps form a more comprehensive understanding with better quality ideas and solutions.</p>\n<p>Keep telling your stories designers. But to avoid plot holes (and heart attacks), write, share, and refine them diligently first.</p>\n",

Like me, maybe you've seen the effect before but didn't know that is how it was achieved.</p>\n<p>A flow field is just a grid of vectors that smoothly and randomly independently change direction but with local continuity.</p>\n<p>Perlin noise is a function that produces a type of random gradient noise. It was initially created to be used in visual effects (for original movie Tron). A good random number generator produces numbers with no relationship and no discernible pattern. However, Perlin noise is helpful because it produces randomness but with a continuous relationship. Like the type of randomness you see in nature, for example, clouds, waves, and patterned textures like marble or wood burls.</p>\n<p>It can be animated over time to give a mesmerizing whorly mess that can be used to drive a flow field and push a bunch of particles around a screen. The result is fun to watch, but it would be more engaging if the user could interact with the animation.</p>\n<p>It took me a while to devise an approach to achieve having the vectors in the flow field be driven by both the Perlin noise and user input.</p>\n<p>The tool I needed was lerp-ing, or linear interpolation. Usually used to animate between two positions, P5.js has a function that works with vectors.</p>\n<p>I let the flow field vectors animate as expected. I then took a copy of the flow field grid and copied the values from the default flow field.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-js\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-js\"> <span class=\"token

Is that what you expected to happen? Are you seeing unexpected wrapping or truncation?</li>\n<li>Change your browser zoom (<code>cmd</code>/<code>ctrl</code> and <code>+</code>/<code>-</code>) as your layout changes.

Are your focus states, controls, icons, and images still accessible?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>☑️ Color usage is purposeful but not overloaded</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use color with purpose and never as decoration. Never use color alone to convey information; ensure that colored text and graphics are understandable when viewed without color. Color-blind and low-vision users may not be able to perceive the color differences, and screen readers do not announce colors to non-sighted readers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>☑️ Content is printable</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check the printed versions of each page.

State Identification <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/ux-of-a-disabled-button/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The difference between a disabled button and a regular button is usually very subtle<sup>*</sup>, meaning it's a weak indicator of state that may be missed by many of your users.</p>\n<p><i>* Designing something to look both disabled and identifiable as a button while achieving adequate contrast is tricky.</i></p>\n<h4 id=\"1-1-what-does-disabling-a-button-from-a-screen-readers-perspective-mean\" tabindex=\"-1\">1.1 What does disabling a button from a Screen Readers perspective mean? <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/ux-of-a-disabled-button/\">#</a></h4>\n<details>\n  <summary>What is a <i>Screen Reader</i>?</summary>\n<p>A screen reader is assistive software primarily used by people with low or no vision. It converts the semantic elements on a web page (for example, text, buttons, images, and links) into audible speech or braille.</p>\n</details>\n<p>A disabled button is non-existent to a Screen Reader user, meaning they don't even get the weak indicator afforded to fully sighted users.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/blindness-and-visual-impairment\">World Health Organization</a>, there are an estimated 285 million people in the world who suffer from some level of visual impairment (including anyone from legally blind, to those with less than 20/20 vision).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"2-unnecessary-cognitive-load\" tabindex=\"-1\">2. Unnecessary Cognitive Load <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/ux-of-a-disabled-button/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>When a disabled button is intended to act as a visual indicator that something on the page or form needs to be fixed/changed before your user can continue.\nTo those who can identify them, this usage of a disabled button tells them &quot;something&quot; is wrong and provides no more information on what needs to be corrected (the user may assume that something is wrong with the application and that it needs to be reloaded).</p>\n<p>The change required to re-enable a disabled control may be appear to be a simple puzzle for your user but this is an assumption we shouldn't make for all our users.\nIntroducing this, potentially, minor frustration for users with or without cognitive disabilities or even familiarity with our product is best avoided in keeping with the &quot;Don't make me think&quot; principle.</p>\n<p>Due to the contrast issues mentioned before, you can't rely on the contents of the buttons label to aid your user here, as they may not be able to read it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"is-there-another-way\" tabindex=\"-1\">Is there another way? <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/ux-of-a-disabled-button/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>There are more suitable patterns and approaches available that can help us avoid using disabled buttons.\nFor example, let's look at the typical approach of using a disabled button to prevent progress on an incomplete form.</p>\n<p>❌ Don't</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Disable the submit button (hoping your user understands that you mean for them to fully complete the form before continuing)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>✅ Do</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mark all required fields (unless all fields are required or there are more optional fields than required)</li>\n<li>Let the user interact with and traverse the form and identify the enabled submit/continue button (both by its label and location)</li>\n<li>Let them attempt to submit the form</li>\n<li>Inform the user precisely what issue is preventing them from continuing. This can be an inline error message or something like the Toast alert pattern</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In other words, allow and use the user's premature interaction with the control as an opportunity to inform or guide them on how to continue.\nThis principle can be applied to many instances where disabled buttons are commonly used.</p>\n<!-- ## When should a disabled button be used\n\n![animation showing an asynchronous action triggered by a button temporarily disabling a button](https://raw.github.ibm.com/DWay/not-important/master/src/images/posts/ux-disabled-buttons/disable-button-pattern.gif) -->\n",

So today, I will talk about how that differs from the common understanding of responsive design and some other things I've learned.</p>\n<p>I'll be talking more abstractly and not very specifically about the code, so hopefully, there's something for everyone here.</p>\n<p>So... I'll start with a definition.</p>\n<p></p><blockquote class=\"c-block-quote\">\n<p class=\"c-block-quote__content\">\nResponsive web design is a technique for making web pages look good on a variety of devices and screen sizes.</p>\n<p></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"c-block-quote__footer\">— <cite>Every responsive design blog post</cite></footer>\n\t\t\t\t</blockquote>\n<p>When you start learning about responsive design, slightly fuzzy definitions like this are usually the kind of thing you'll see.</p>\n<p>This seems straightforward, so let's unpack this and get started. We can learn the basics of those techniques in the next 5 minutes.</p>\n<p></p><blockquote class=\"c-block-quote\">\n<p class=\"c-block-quote__content\">\nResponsive web design is a technique for making web pages look good on <strong>a variety of devices and screen sizes</strong>.</p>\n<p></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"c-block-quote__footer\">— <cite>Every responsive design blog post</cite></footer>\n\t\t\t\t</blockquote>\n<p>If we're designing responsively, we will support multiple screen sizes. Ultimately, this means we must make changes or interventions in our designs to accommodate the real estate differences those screens offer.</p>\n<p>We'll make interventions to keep our designs looking good, or at least not break them. Let's look at some tools and techniques available for making these responsive interventions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tools-of-the-trade\" tabindex=\"-1\">Tools of the trade <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/\">#</a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"breakpoints\" tabindex=\"-1\">Breakpoints <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/\">#</a></h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/images/break-points.svg\" alt=\"Nested rectangles abstractly representing three different screen sizes\"></p>\n<p>We'll start by choosing some screens or window sizes to support; we'll call these our breakpoints. The purpose of selecting breakpoints is to give us a representative sample of ways that our users will experience our designs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/images/break-points-1.svg\" alt=\"break-points-1\"></p>\n<p>Our designs will start mobile-first, meaning our smallest screens are the default layout; any additional space is treated as a progressive enhancement. Space is not something we can assume we'll have, and it is not required for our designs to work.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/images/break-points-2.svg\" alt=\"break-points-2\"></p>\n<p>But we'll make the most of it when we do have it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/images/break-points-3.svg\" alt=\"break-points-3\"></p>\n<p>This mobile-first approach can help focus our designs and ensure they work well, first in the more restrictive environments of smaller devices.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/images/break-points-labelled.svg\" alt=\"break-points-labelled\"></p>\n<p>So, let's choose some standard screen sizes and start making our interventions at those points; these are the ones Bootstrap uses.</p>\n<p>We may need to make additional interventions and tweaks to our designs between these points once we have our content in... but these are the main changes we'll see.</p>\n<h3 id=\"media-queries\" tabindex=\"-1\">Media queries <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The magical media query is the next tool we learn about.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/images/example-media-query.gif\" alt=\"example-media-queries.gif\"></p>\n<p>Here's what they look like if you've never seen one (this is the only code I'll show today). It seems like an <code>If</code> statement because that's basically what it is. Just a conditional check on the current screen width, and then some styles to apply when that condition is met.</p>\n<p>In this example, the background of our page is tomato red. The new style is applied if our breakpoint has been reached, setting the background light blue.</p>\n<p>We'll want to use our breakpoints to intervene in our design. These media queries are how we achieve new layouts at those breakpoints, but instead of simply changing colors, we conditionally apply new dimensions, positions, and directions to our elements.</p>\n<h3 id=\"grid-systems-and-percentage-widths\" tabindex=\"-1\">Grid systems and percentage widths <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/\">#</a></h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/images/traditional-grid.svg\" alt=\"traditional-grid.svg\"></p>\n<p>Next, we have percentage widths and the traditional Grid systems you may already know. Hopefully, it's easy to see how we can use media queries to systemize our chosen breakpoints and build something like a traditional responsive grid system.</p>\n<p>Responsive Grids allow us to abstract repeatable structures in our designs and divide the space on our page into proportional columns. We use our breakpoints as markers for interventions and choose how to best adapt our content to fit the available space.</p>\n<p>Better still, these columns are sized as percentages of the available space, so our columns constantly proportionally adjust and respond between our breakpoints!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/images/invision-blog-responsive-hero-rwd-1-animated.gif\" alt=\"invision-blog-responsive-hero-rwd-1-animated.gif\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"in-conclusion\" tabindex=\"-1\">In conclusion? <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>After we apply these tools to our designs, responsive design has been achieved! 🚢</p>\n<p>It's straightforward to build robust and dynamic designs that adapt to our user's needs...almost too easy if you ask me.</p>\n<p>Wait, why is the scrollbar only halfway down the page!?</p>\n<h2 id=\"be-the-browsers-mentor-not-its-micromanager\" tabindex=\"-1\">Be the browsers mentor, not its micromanager <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, there are a lot of limitations to these approaches that aren't immediately intuitive, or they weren't to me anyway. Much learning around responsive design starts and ends with the material I've shared.</p>\n<p>These techniques are not sufficient and never really were. They're simply the best tools we had for a long time.</p>\n<p></p><blockquote class=\"c-block-quote\" cite=\"https://wcag.com/designers/1-4-1-reflow/\">\n<p class=\"c-block-quote__content\">\nSuccess Criterion 1.4.10 Reflow (Level AA): Content can be presented without loss of information or functionality and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions...</p>\n<p></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"c-block-quote__footer\">— <cite>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</cite></footer>\n\t\t\t\t</blockquote>\n<p>When it comes to supporting a responsive design as an accessibility requirement (not just supporting some arbitrary screen sizes), there are other factors to consider, ones that can't be catered for with these techniques.</p>\n<p>The documentation for the reflow success criteria on the Web Accessibility Initiative's accessibility checklist is a good resource for helping to understand what I mean and is well worth reading. Let's examine why this basic responsive approach doesn't solve our reflow problems and why it doesn't scale well.</p>\n<h3 id=\"responsive-vs-systematically-responsive\" tabindex=\"-1\">Responsive vs. Systematically responsive <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>The basic approach I've discussed is only really effective where three things are known ahead of time:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The <strong>context</strong> of your content (I'll explain what I mean soon)</li>\n<li>The <strong>content</strong> your designs will contain</li>\n<li>The way your user has <strong>configured</strong> their browser</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When designing responsively at scale, all three of these are unknowns or known to be variable.</p>\n<p></p><blockquote class=\"c-block-quote\" cite=\"https://alistapart.com/article/dao/\">\n<p class=\"c-block-quote__content\">\nWhen first learning responsive design, we tend to take a print designer's approach, with fixed widths and fixed paper sizes in mind. In reality, we should embrace the fact that the web doesn't have the same constraints as printed page, and design with its flexibility in mind.</p>\n<p></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<footer class=\"c-block-quote__footer\">— <cite>A Dao of Web Design by John Allsopp</cite></footer>\n\t\t\t\t</blockquote>\n<h4 id=\"why-they-are-unknown\" tabindex=\"-1\">Why they are unknown <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/\">#</a></h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/images/screen-size-vs-context-1.svg\" alt=\"screen-size-vs-context-1\"></p>\n<p>First, there's a subtle difference between your user's <strong>screen size</strong> and your <strong>user's context</strong>.</p>\n<p>Highlighted here, you can see &quot;screen size&quot;. We have relied on this red box for the condition of all our responsive interventions so far. But Our user's context accounts for a lot more and is independent of screen size in the following ways:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/images/screen-size-vs-context-zoom.svg\" alt=\"screen-size-vs-context-zoom\"></p>\n<p><strong>Zoom</strong> - users have control over the zoom level of the content on their page; notice the screen size doesn't change, but the content does.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/images/screen-size-vs-context-translate.svg\" alt=\"screen-size-vs-context-translate\"></p>\n<p><strong>Language</strong> - Secondly, your content will be translated. Translation often leads to different space requirements for the same content. If you've ever found yourself tweaking a fixed width to contain some piece of content exactly, you'll find your German users are now experiencing a lot of unintended truncation or wrapping.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"c-inset-text\">\n<span>\nSide note: fixed dimensions are your enemy in responsive design. 🔥\n</span>\n</div><p></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/images/base-font-settings.png\" alt=\"base-font-settings\"></p>\n<p><strong>Base font size/letter spacing</strong> - Another way the space required by your content can change is due to the control the browsers give to the user over what their base font (or body copy) can be, not only altering the dimensions of our content but also potentially affecting visual hierarchy of our designs. These are tools provided as an aid to the accessibility of our websites. We should accommodate this behavior, not fight it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/images/screen-size-vs-context-position.svg\" alt=\"screen-size-vs-context-position\"></p>\n<p><strong>Position</strong> - when building at scale, you're likely building by composing components. Building components, you should also be aware that you're building containers for variable content in variable contexts.</p>\n<p>The position, and as a result, the proportion of the page your component will occupy, is not always knowable or obvious.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/images/screen-size-vs-dynamic-content.svg\" alt=\"screen-size-vs-context-dynamic-content\"></p>\n<p><strong>Dynamic content</strong> - When building systems for others to use and configure, you rarely control the actual content that gets placed inside those systems.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Zoom</li>\n<li>Language/Internationalization</li>\n<li>Base font size</li>\n<li>Dynamic content</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In short, designing responsively without these things in mind will lead to your content and layout being malformed, obscured, truncated, or challenging to consume for someone, probably not you.\nAn excellent responsive measure of your UI is how it handles this list of variables.</p>\n<p>Let's quickly summarize what this means for the old way of being responsive.</p>\n<h3 id=\"myth-1-our-breakpoints-are-how-our-users-will-see-our-designs\" tabindex=\"-1\">Myth #1 - Our breakpoints are how our users will see our designs <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/\">#</a></h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/images/screen-sizes.svg\" alt=\"screen-sizes\"></p>\n<p>The massive proliferation of devices means there is no actual set of standard dimensions to design for.</p>\n<p>As we saw, our selected breakpoints are arbitrary to the point of uselessness and are a very shallow representative sample of our user's context. There are numerous other factors to account for that affect how our users see our designs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"myth-2-grids-and-media-queries-allow-us-to-adapt-our-design-to-best-fit-the-available-space\" tabindex=\"-1\">Myth #2 - Grids and Media queries allow us to adapt our design to best fit the available space <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/\">#</a></h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/images/nothing-to-respond-to.svg\" alt=\"nothing-to-respond-to\"></p>\n<p>Being squishy alone is not being responsive. Grids and layouts that depend on media queries don't adapt to available space. They adapt only to the screen size they're viewed in.</p>\n<p>Because all these variables are unknown, responsive design is ultimately designed for an environment you'll never see.</p>\n<p>We must use whatever the content and purpose or intent of our design rather than arbitrary device widths to determine where interventions should be made.</p>\n<h3 id=\"myth-3-design-is-aesthetics\" tabindex=\"-1\">Myth #3 - Design is aesthetics <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/\">#</a></h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Design is a plan for arranging elements in such a way as best to accomplish a particular purpose.&quot; ― Charles Eames, American designer, architect, and filmmaker</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The purpose of design, responsive or not, is not to look nice, not primarily anyway. As old Charlie puts it, design is a plan to purposely arrange elements.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;<strong>Responsive</strong> Design is a plan for arranging elements in such a way as best to accomplish a particular purpose, <strong>across contexts.</strong>&quot; ― <s>Charles Eames, American designer, architect, and filmmaker</s> - Micheal Scott</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Responsive design is an extension of this: maintaining a plan for arranging with purpose across contexts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-do-you-mean-by-purpose\" tabindex=\"-1\">What do you mean by purpose? <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>To clarify what I mean by purpose. The size, position, and relationship elements have between each other on a page; all this is purposeful. Here are some quick samples of examples related to layout.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/images/law-of-proximity.svg\" alt=\"law-of-proximity\"></p>\n<p>Law of proximity: Objects close to each other are perceived to be related when compared with separated elements. The amount of spacing between elements can be used to denote relatedness.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/images/law-scannable-text.svg\" alt=\"law-scannable-text\"></p>\n<p>Line Measure: The width of a line of text, in characters, is known as its measure. Reasonable measure is critical for the comfortable scanning of successive lines of text. Usually, a value between 45 and 75 characters is reasonable. Note this is independent of screen or font size.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/images/law-visual-hierachy.svg\" alt=\"law-visual-hierarchy\"></p>\n<p>Content Hierarchy: A strong and relative visual hierarchy must be created and maintained. What is most important on the page should be obvious to the user. This applies to typography and the visual impact of the other elements on your page.</p>\n<h4 id=\"example-of-purpose\" tabindex=\"-1\">Example of purpose <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/\">#</a></h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/images/purpose.svg\" alt=\"Three column of sample body text, each with it's own header. Each header is closer to each body than each column is to another.\"></p>\n<p>Let's look at a simple example to demonstrate purpose in design.\nSay we must display 3 pieces of text, each with its own heading.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The 3 text elements have equal visual weight because they are equally important.</li>\n<li>The text elements have a spatial relationship to each other and their headings. They are more related to their headings than to each other.</li>\n<li>The text and their headings have a size relationship to each other, denoting hierarchy and helping with comprehension.</li>\n<li>The text remains readable (a sensible minimum and maximum measure should be maintained)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What must the layout that holds this content achieve to retain this original purpose across contexts?</p>\n<p>Think back to our unknowns (language, context, font size, zoom, position) and how they can interfere with our intended purpose here.\nMaking judgments on <strong>when</strong> our layout should adapt to maintain that purpose is not possible when the only adjustments we can make are in relation to screen size.</p>\n<p>Using traditional interventions to maintain the meaning of our designs is an unachievable task. Absolutely not! We've just been approaching things with the wrong mindset and from the wrong direction.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-should-we-respond-to\" tabindex=\"-1\">What should we respond to? <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>What should we respond to if responding to our user's screen size is not helpful? Your content is the reason your user visits your site, and its accessibility to them should be your primary concern. But when designing systems or platforms, your content is provided or configured into the product by your customers. Your designs should try to respond to and maintain the purpose or intent of the layout and be robust enough to gracefully handle the additional variable qualities of both content and context.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how\" tabindex=\"-1\">How? <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Instead of starting on the outside (our screen size), We can start from the inside and work our way out. We want to build our designs in a way that minimizes the need for us to intervene. As we've seen, responsive design is designing for an environment you'll never really see anyway.</p>\n<p>To do this, we should think about our layouts as ways to influence our content with tolerances and acceptable ranges. Think of yourself as the browser's mentor rather than its micro-manager. If we want our layout to be intrinsically responsive to the content and context it is exposed to, we'll need better tools.</p>\n<h2 id=\"better-tools-of-the-trade\" tabindex=\"-1\">Better tools of the trade <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/\">#</a></h2>\n<h3 id=\"rems-and-modular-scale\" tabindex=\"-1\">Rems and Modular scale <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/\">#</a></h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/images/type-hierarchy.svg\" alt=\"type hierarchy\"></p>\n<p>Starting at the very middle with our text. Rems or root Ems are relative properties where 1 Rem equals one times the default base font size.</p>\n<p>They allow you to build your typographical hierarchy using one or more ratios relative to the base font size.</p>\n<p>This means if the base font is changed (through user settings or browser plugin), the proportions of your typography scales with it, and therefore, the meaning between your type levels is maintained! You can also use rems in the same way for spacing.</p>\n<h3 id=\"flexbox-and-css-grid\" tabindex=\"-1\">Flexbox and CSS Grid <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>These tools are relatively new (5 years) but are well-supported by modern browsers. They allow us to describe layouts with no (or much less) human interventions required.</p>\n<p>While Media queries can be viewed as simple <strong>if</strong> statements based on page size, Flexbox/CSS grid can be viewed as mini algorithms or layout machines that are more context/content-aware and allow us to abstract the purpose of our designs in ways that are independent of things out of our control like zoom, language and font size.</p>\n<h3 id=\"flexbox\" tabindex=\"-1\">Flexbox <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Flexbox lets us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>✅ Set ideal widths/heights and guard rails for when those ideals cannot be met.</li>\n<li>✅ Grow and shrink elements proportionally to each other (maintaining hierarchy and visual impact) or prevent items from growing or shrinking at all.</li>\n<li>✅ Control and and provide context to scoped containers that is independent of the number of elements there will be.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Flexbox allows us to set ideal or basis widths - without stopping elements from growing and shrinking when appropriate. It also allows us to grow and shrink related elements at given ratios.</p>\n<p>We can set the minimum and maximum widths for child elements as percentage values of the parent container width. This allows us to mimic some behavior of container queries, letting elements respond to their own size, not the pages. An example will help demonstrate why all this is useful to us.</p>\n<h4 id=\"flexbox-example\" tabindex=\"-1\">Flexbox example <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/\">#</a></h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/images/sidebar-rule.svg\" alt=\"sidebar-rule\"></p>\n<p>The Sidebar rule - a Sidebar is defined as an area of secondary importance to the main area of importance\nIn layout, it is usually safe to equate real estate with importance, so with that in mind with Flexbox\nwe can build a layout that behaves like as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Put &quot;Sidebar&quot; beside the &quot;Main&quot; area, When &quot;Main&quot; is greater than or equal to half the available space (not half the page size).</li>\n<li>When &quot;Sidebar&quot; and &quot;Main&quot; are the same size, &quot;Sidebar&quot; is no longer a sidebar; let's make an intervention and stack these elements instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This abstraction of a layout has a purpose and can maintain it, independent of screen size and our other variables.</p>\n<h3 id=\"css-grid\" tabindex=\"-1\">CSS Grid <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>CSS grids differ from traditional ones in that they can be configured to adapt to more complex and dynamic content. They can easily infer what to do with additional elements based on some given criteria.</p>\n<h4 id=\"css-grid-example\" tabindex=\"-1\">CSS Grid example <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/\">#</a></h4>\n<pre class=\"language-css\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token selector\">.l-grid__inner</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n\t<span class=\"token property\">grid-template-columns</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token function\">repeat</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>auto-fill<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token function\">minmax</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>15rem<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> 1fr<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/images/css-grid-1.svg\" alt=\"css-grid-1\"></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here's an example of some ways you can set up a CSS grid.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/images/css-grid-2.svg\" alt=\"css-grid-2\"></p>\n<p>repeat means columns are created on demand to accommodate any number of child elements</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/images/css-grid-3.svg\" alt=\"css-grid-3\"></p>\n<p>The <code>auto-fill</code> property tells the grid that columns can be added or removed if needed depending on the number of elements and the next value which allows us to set a tolerant range for what we consider to be acceptable sizes of those columns.</p>\n<p>In this case, the minimum column width is 15 times the base font size (maintaining a readable line measure for contained content). The maximum of 1fr means all columns should then expand and equally share any extra space when available.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-difference-between-flexbox-and-css-grid\" tabindex=\"-1\">The difference between Flexbox and CSS Grid <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/\">#</a></h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/images/flexbox-vs-grid.svg\" alt=\"flexbox-vs-grid\"></p>\n<p>You'll commonly use both Grid and Flexbox in combination with each other but if you're ever wondering how to choose between these two tools, this little illustration is all you need.</p>\n<p>If you require elements of variable size to behave responsively, <strong>use Flexbox</strong>; examples might include button groups, category tags, or any text-like content.</p>\n<p><strong>Use CSS grid</strong> if you require your elements to maintain uniform sizing and 2 dimensional alignment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"container-queries\" tabindex=\"-1\">Container queries <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/\">#</a></h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/images/container-queries.svg\" alt=\"container-queries\"></p>\n<p>Container queries are a long-awaited, recent addition to the responsive design toolbox. Container queries allow us to apply styles to an element based on the size of the element's container. This seems like our previously maligned Media queries; however, responding to the element's available space rather than the page size is a much more powerful and dependable way to base styling decisions.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token atrule\"><span class=\"token rule\">@container</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token property\">min-width</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> 380px<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n\t<span class=\"token comment\">/* When the card is at least 380px wide*/</span>\n\t<span class=\"token selector\">.c-card</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n\t\t<span class=\"token property\">flex-direction</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> row<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token comment\">/* change the layout of its content */</span>\n\t<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"inherently-responsive-patterns\" tabindex=\"-1\">Inherently responsive patterns <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Some patterns are more inherently responsive than others and are worth learning about, too.</p>\n<p><strong>Dynamic, progressive disclosure</strong> - The priority plus is one good example. This pattern usually requires JavaScript. It is inherently responsive because it is agnostic to where it's placed, how many items you put in it, or the sizes of those items.</p>\n<div>\n<iframe height=\"300\" style=\"width: 100%;\" scrolling=\"no\" title=\"Drop Away Nav\" src=\"https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/embed/GJRXYE?default-tab=result&theme-id=dark\" frameborder=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\">\n  See the Pen <a href=\"https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/GJRXYE\">\n  Drop Away Nav</a> by Chris Coyier  (<a href=\"https://codepen.io/chriscoyier\">@chriscoyier</a>)\n  on <a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a>.\n</iframe>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Scrollable tabs</strong> - This pattern is inherently responsive and easy to interact with because it displays left and right scroll buttons that are hidden when the tabs do not overflow the available area.</p>\n<div>\n<picture><source type=\"image/avif\" srcset=\"https://david-way.github.io/img/KJE43X6r6B-815.avif 815w\"><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://david-way.github.io/img/KJE43X6r6B-815.webp 815w\"><img alt=\"Scrollable tabs with scroll button(s) visible when the tabs overflow the available area.\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://david-way.github.io/img/KJE43X6r6B-815.png\" width=\"815\" height=\"98\"></picture>\n<figcaption>\n    Source: <a href=\"https://mui.com/material-ui/react-tabs/\">MUI React Library</a>.\n</figcaption>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\" tabindex=\"-1\">Conclusion <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/responsive-systems/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I hope this helped give an idea of the problems and solutions that exist in the responsive design space if you're starting out.\nIf you're interested in learning more, I highly recommend a book called <a href=\"https://every-layout.dev/\">Every Layout</a> by Heydon Pickering and the indispensible resource that is <a href=\"https://buildexcellentwebsit.es/\">buildexcellentwebsit.es</a> by Andy Bell.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading this far!</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Providing color utilities in your design system can be a risk to the accessibility of the products built with it. Providing <a href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/design-system-color-utilities/\">automated, integrated accessibility testing and linting rules</a> can limit this risk, and providing <a href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/design-system-color-utilities/\">high-level design and usage guidance and technical implementation details together</a> is a bonus, too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"with-great-power\" tabindex=\"-1\">With great power... <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/design-system-color-utilities/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>A footgun refers to something designed to be highly likely to be used in a way that will cause more problems than it solves.</p>\n<p>A CSS utility class applies a single abstracted rule or a collection of simple rules, typically scoped to achieve a particular pattern. In the context of a Design System, it is also an efficient sanctioned/supported way to extend system design decisions to custom components and variants.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of a utility class for applying lead typography styles.</p>\n<pre class=\"language-css\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token comment\">/** _utils.scss - how it's made */</span>\n<span class=\"token selector\">.u-type\\:lead</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n\t<span class=\"token property\">font-size</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> 22px<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\t<span class=\"token property\">font-weight</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> 400<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\t<span class=\"token property\">line-height</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> 34px<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\t<span class=\"token property\">max-width</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> 77rem<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n<pre class=\"language-html\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token comment\">&lt;!-- index.html - how it's used --></span>\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>p</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">class</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>u-type:lead<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n\tA lead paragraph is the opening paragraph of an article, book chapter, or\n\tother written work that summarizes its main ideas.\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>p</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code></pre>\n<p></p><div class=\"c-inset-text\">\n<span>\nUnless you're working with a utility first approach, prefixing utility classes with a <code>u-</code> is a useful way to make the source of its effect more obvious (utilities will often be <code>!important</code> with high specificity, overriding other styles, seeing a utility class on an object helps to explain this behavior if it's unexpected)\n</span>\n</div><p></p>\n<p>Providing utility classes to Design System consumers as part of your established API is an easy decision with clear value. Utility classes help developers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Maintain consistency</strong> - by making it easy to be consistent with color choices and purpose, spacing, typography, shadows, and other aesthetic flourishes that should be globally applied to all components, compositions, extensions, and custom implementations.</li>\n<li><strong>Improve Efficiency</strong> - utility classes can <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself\">DRY</a> out the styles delivered to the browser by abstracting some of the more commonly applied styles and simplify the work required to use the design language to any extensions or customizations of the Design System contents.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid common issues</strong> - utilities help abstract robust, cross-browser solutions to complex or unintuitive front-end development problems.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Utility classes are very powerful development tool. Our Design System provides utility classes for spacing, elevation, animation, display type, visibility across breakpoints, maintaining aspect ratio, visually joining elements, and scoping different themes inline in a page.</p>\n<p>Though it was one of the most commonly requested, color was the last category of utilities we included. The primary concerns were accessibility-related but also aesthetic. Our experience with customization meant we didn't trust that these utilities would be used wisely and therefore thought it was safer they never existed in the first place.</p>\n<p>I gathered examples of customer requests related to color and analyzed the themes. When a client wants to apply color to a design, they usually intend to elevate the visual impact of a specific element or &quot;make it pop&quot;, usually in a manner that would be guaranteed to upset the balance or visual hierarchy of the page.</p>\n<p>Another more valid use case was the commonly occurring need to apply colors to elements that colors can be used to reflect system status.</p>\n<h2 id=\"solution\" tabindex=\"-1\">Solution <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/design-system-color-utilities/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>What are the accessibility implications of using color as decoration? What are the conventional and cultural connotations of this color. Which users need to receive the information you're imparting with color? Which colors are safe to use, and where are they safe to use? How can color affect the balance and hierarchy of the page? Is the element you want to make more impactful going to outweigh other elements on the page? These are many questions a designer asks before deciding the appropriate use of a color.</p>\n<p>One solution to minimize the risks of developers not asking (or knowing to ask) these questions was to A. <a href=\"https://heydonworks.com/article/how-i-accidentally-killed-several-ux-designers/\">document high-level design guidance and technical implementation details next to each other on the same page</a>, and B. provide automated tooling to check for accessibility issues and to remind developers to manually check and consider their usage.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-automation-and-tooling\" tabindex=\"-1\">A.

The micro-architecture is selected for a specific application (for example, general-purpose consumer use, enterprise-grade, scientific computing, or embedded system) and a suitable performance level.</p>\n<p>The implementation logic of the CPU is constructed by abstract specification of desired circuit behavior\nthrough the selection of appropriate components e.g. Arithmetic Logic Units (ALU), registers, and cache memory and clocks.\nThe CAD software translates these specifications into the required circuits, logic devices, and logic gates and ultimately the transistors that make them. These elements are printed, in layers, to a silicone wafer between 0.5mm and 400 microns in thickness. The design is also analyzed and simulated to assess manufacturability and design integrity.</p>\n<h3 id=\"masking-and-fabrication\" tabindex=\"-1\">Masking and Fabrication <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/how-to-trick-rocks-into-doing-math/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>Manufacturing transistors, at the required scale and precision the achieve the modern CPU performance levels, is not possible with typical manufacturing processes. Even the most precise 3D printers are not suitable for the nano-metre scale of today’s chips. Photolithography is a multi-step process of using light to print or etch the design of many chips onto a thin silicon wafer.</p>\n<p>The printing process begins in a sterile environment by applying hydrogen peroxide to a substrate to remove any contaminants. A thin layer of silicon is deposited on the substrate and spun to uniformly cover it in another layer of photo-resistant chemical which is then baked into place. This layer is less than 2 micro-metres thick. A photo mask of the chip design is placed above the wafer and an extreme intensity UV light source is focused through it. This projects an image of the design that exposes and chemically alters the photoresist where the light reaches it. The photoresist is then treated to develop the exposed regions, preventing further light-induced alteration, and washed away from the unexposed regions. A chemical is used to remove the uppermost layer of the substrate not covered by the photoresist mask, etching the design into the wafer. The photoresist is removed, the surface is polished, and the process is repeated in as many layers as needed to complete the chip design.</p>\n<h2 id=\"packaging\" tabindex=\"-1\">Packaging <a class=\"c-header-anchor\" href=\"https://david-way.github.io/blog/how-to-trick-rocks-into-doing-math/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The delicate silicone die added to a carrier is attached to the printed circuit board (PCB) allowing it to connect, via a pin and socket, to the rest of the computer system.

A lot of effort is put into avoiding defects but when they do occur, binning is used to mitigate waste. If the defect occurs in a redundant or non-essential component of the CPU like a core, that component is disabled and the CPU is sold as a lower-end part.</p>\n<p>The CPUs are then packaged for retail to customers or sold to OEMs for inclusion in their products.</p>\n",
