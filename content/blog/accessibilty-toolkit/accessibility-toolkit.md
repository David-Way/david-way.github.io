Humans are the only species for whom tool use is a defining and universal characteristic.

What I value most in good tools is how they embody the toolmakers knowledge and the expertise related to the tasks and needs they were designed to address. They crystallize, refine, and facilitate the sharing of this knowledge and expertise. Good tools can provide solutions while teaching you more about the underlying problems.

It's easy to over rely and over-focus on tooling (at the expense of studying theory and gaining practical experience) but when approaching a new domain, deeply learning about available tools can be a great introduction to learning about the domain.

In the last year I've been learning deeply and applying the concepts and principles of accessible digital product design. Here is a list of tools and resources I've found particularly useful.

## Web Design Tools

  "WebAim Color contrast checker",
  "https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/",
  "Contrast is a measure of the difference in perceived 'luminance' or brightness between two colors. Having enough contrast is vital to ensure users with visual disabilities, must be able to perceive content on the page."
%}
{% describedlink
  "Deque color contrast checker",
  "https://dequeuniversity.com/color-contrast",
  "Much like the WebAim contrast checker but it uses a different algorithm and can give slightly different results. It's worth testing with both tools if your values are just barely meeting minimum contrast requirements."
%}
{% describedlink
  "Deque aria usage patterns",
  "https://dequeuniversity.com/library/",
  "A code library of accessibility focused work in progress examples."
%}
{% describedlink
  "Axe browser extension",

{% describedlink
  "WebFX",

## Bookmarklets

<details>
  <summary>What is a bookmarklet?</summary>

A browser bookmarklet is a small piece of JavaScript code saved as a bookmark in a web browser.

Bookmarklets can perform a specific action when clicked and be used to manipulate , interact with the current webpage and its content.

{% describedlink
  "ANDI",
  "https://www.ssa.gov/accessibility/andi/help/install.html/",
  "Accessible Name & Description Inspector (ANDI) is a free accessibility testing tool."
%}
{% describedlink
  "Full Current Page DOM HTML Validator",
  "https://dequeuniversity.com/validator",
  "This bookmarklet is the most convenient way of using the W3C HTML Validator service."
%}

A long list of very specific bookmarklets can be found on [Paul J. Adam](https://pauljadam.com/bookmarklets.html)'s consultancy site.
