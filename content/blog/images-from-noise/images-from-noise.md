I'm not in classes territory yet but <i>20/20</i> my eyesight is not. I've no visual conditions, but you could say I've had too many birthdays to not be thinking about some form of corrective eye wear in the not too distant future. Dispite this, I'm one of those that have a strangely tuned eye for spotting AI generated images. 

I recently walked jetlagged through an Osaka market, in a very busy, vibrant and overwhelming street. At least fifty meters ahead, a cluster of hoodies swung low from the front of a building. In a street overflowing with color and noise and things forgeign to me, those hoodies stood out. I couldn't make out what was on them at first but I was immedeately certain they were covered in AI-generated images. My certainty and discomfort grew with each step closer. These were some mad and wrectched objects.

Can the barrier to entry for creativity be too low? Is there such a thing as bad art? Thanks to AI, yeah I guess, now there is. There was a cruel but useful filter built into the old way images were made. People who, I do not count myself among, have developed the skills required produce something had at least the ability to learn something. The time and skill investment encouraged the creator to consider if the result would be worth the effort.

Lowering or removing that barrier completely opens the floodgates to people less interested in the craft of creativity and getting better at it, and more interested in commerce. With the aim to create things that should maybe have remained un-created. Or are not worth the energy externality cost to the environment even if they are worth the time cost of the prompt writer.

I wondered are those whos skills and interests are more aligned with pure commerce delighted they no longer have to collaborate with creative people to fill their shelves with what appears to them to be costless equivalents? Are they concerned about the result if everyone else did the same?

The more art and designs we have the better right? More variety can be liberating. But what is it all to be used for? To sell? To deceive? To displace? When the primary goal is units shifted, I almost grieve a little the lost opportunity to have something made that might have been worth producing.

Supporting artists may or may not be of interest to you, but there are other reasons why knowing whether an image is AI-generated or not might be important or relevant to you. Ethical, legal, creative attribution and ultimately to provide base level context into how to interpret the image.  Buying a product, images are now no longer on enough proof of quality, that the item exists exists, or a good indicator of what will arrive at your doorstep.

AI tools are improving all their quality (deceptiveness?) all the time and experts and tools do exist out there for analyzing digital images that are also improving right along side the AI tools, but out in the world, when you’re standing in a market staring at a hoodie, you’re on your own. So how do you tell?

## Too good to be true
Tendency towards sensationalist, unlikely, garish or exaggerated details. Where a human might draw or be likely to photograph say a 3-4 horse herd, ai will generate 10-100 horses. Real photography rarely has every detail in perfect focus, maximum use of and perfect framing of content, or every element of drama cranked to the visual maximum. Consider the source, do they have the skills, or means to achieve this level of production.

## A lack of real-world understanding
Statistically averaging out concepts from multiple images can create convincing at a glance results but one layer of knowledge down these averages often don't understand the meanings and limits and circumstances in the reference images and leave them behind for their munged together rendition. Would a garden of that size have a hose that would be wrapped that many times? Would someone put a full sized window into an internal wall? Does that stage lighting set make sense? Why does the stitching of the seam end there? Would those three lanes merge into one that close together?

## Perspective problems
Multiple vanishing points, misaligned geometry, objects that don’t quite meet or intersect naturally, little spatial betrayals reveal a model guessing rather than observing (or making local desicions about composition that need a larger context).

## Watch the shadows...
Lack of understanding and applications of the physics of light. AI to a degree understands these concepts, by example, but not to the level required to implement them in the calculated simulation level of detail required for convincing simulation. Look for different shadows being cast from illogical light sources.

## Boxy, geometric tendencies
Tendency towards boxy geometric forms and non-intersecting overlapping edges, right angled furniture, avoidance of complex natural or vague edges. Definitive and distinct separation borders.

## English everywhere
English language text, preponderance of the English in places you might not expect to typically see it.

## Uncanny composition
Uncanny valley level of photo realism, unusual or ambiguous arrangement of objects in space. Lack of artistic composition or expression.

High saturation, tendency towards vivid unbalanced colors, higher contrast. Attention grabbing, reality distorting. Unrealistic outcomes, another"too good to be true" metric.

## The absence of human intention
This is the hardest one to articulate but the easiest to feel. Hollow soulless, lacking the intention or artistic conveyance of emotion. Ask yourself "Why did/would someone produce this image?" Does this have a human point of view? Does it have the tool-marks of a culture? To take a photo is to actively frame and selectively edit and capture a slice of time and space, to record a version of reality. To paint or draw an image is to conjure forms and shapes to illustrate a feeling, capture a moment. Communicate a relationship to society. Ai images tend to lack depth of purpose, or meaningful drama, sugary calories with no nutritional value. Or are a ham handed attempt at it. A lack of a point of view, a lack of tacit knowledge, because you never had to develop them through iterating and growing through a participial talent.

Back in that market, I didn't buy that hoodie if you were wondering. Not because of the tool that was used to make it but because I felt this particular instance wasn't made by anyone for anyone in particular. I do beleive the tool is not nessesarily the problem and that creativity exercised, assisted by and achieved using AI. I just hope the those creative people will continue to develope the skills they need to use these tools wisely.
