CHANGE THIS TO A PROJECT

Push left as a concept

 "push left" (or shift-left) principle means moving quality, security, and testing activities earlier in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), from late stages (like production) to earlier ones (planning, design, coding) to find and fix issues sooner when they're cheaper and easier to resolve, creating a more proactive, less reactive development culture


You don't get much more left in the software development cycle than in design. An so a new responsibility falls on you to mitigate and abate a substantial subset of accessibility issues before they become more expensive and harmful problems further down the pipelines.


I often see a mix of anxiety, concentration, and hesitation in the eyes of my fellow designers.

How can a designer, 

I've written at length on accessability concepts including [Systematic Responsive Design](), [Accessibilty design tools](https://www.davidway.ie/blog/accessibilty-toolkit/accessibility-toolkit/#web-design-tools), [Accessibility reference material](https://www.davidway.ie/blog/accessibilty-toolkit/accessibility-toolkit/#web-design-tools), and [assistive technology tools](https://www.davidway.ie/blog/how-to-get-started-with-voice-over/). 


Some great [structured learning](https://www.davidway.ie/blog/how-to-get-started-with-voice-over/) on the topic


I believer that there is a role for structured learning on the topic but if you don't have time to dedicate, the following is a checklist you can you to familiarize yourself with basic concepts as you need them and efficiently apply and expand that knowledge in the context of a working problem, as it becomes immediately relevant to the pieces of UI you are currently working on.
